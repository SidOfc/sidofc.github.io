    <title>Sidney Liebrand's blog - Building a Next.js page load progress bar</title>
    <summary>I&apos;ve seen a fair few tutorials on building a page load progress bar for Next.js applications but most of them use the external library NProgress. While NProgress is a very nice general purpose library we can also build our own &apos;cheap&apos; progress bar without using any library!</summary>

    <title>Sidney Liebrand's blog - Creating my own vim statusline</title>
    <summary>Recently I decided to clean up my vim plugins once again, I do not think I use too many but I prefer to keep my setup simple. One of the things which bothered me was the configuration for lightline.vim in my vim config. It seemed needlessly complex and I wondered if I could recreate it without any plugins at all!</summary>

    <title>Sidney Liebrand's blog - Recruiters who call during working hours</title>
    <summary>Any kind of cold-call from some random recruiter or sales rep is annoying enough as is. Imagine my frustration when I got a call from a recruiter who called on the &lt;strong&gt;company phone&lt;/strong&gt; in the middle of a working day!</summary>

    <title>Sidney Liebrand's blog - Vim tip: persistent undo</title>
    <summary>Usually, when you open a file in your editor, make some changes, save and close, you lose the ability to &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Z&lt;/kbd&gt;. Vim has a built in mechanism to persist changes made to files on disk. This may not sound that exciting, but what if your editor crashes while you have a set of changes you may want to revert stored?</summary>

    <title>Sidney Liebrand's blog - How FZF and ripgrep improved my workflow</title>
    <summary>In my never ending quest for simplicity I recently discovered FZF and ripgrep. Two command-line tools that have the potential to make every dag programming tasks easier. In this post I will explain how I use these tools to do things in a matter of keystrokes rather than having to re-google that command you keep forgetting &lt;strong&gt;every. single. time.&lt;/strong&gt;.</summary>

    <title>Sidney Liebrand's blog - The greatnesses and gotchas of YAML</title>
    <summary>YAML is a great language for configuration files, it is a lot more flexible than JSON with comments and inheritance for example. While I was doing some research about YAML I found bits of information scattered all over the place so I attempted to piece the great things and the quirks together in a post!</summary>

    <title>Sidney Liebrand's blog - Combining Caniuse with FZF</title>
    <summary>There is caniuse.com which you can use to search online, but what if you&apos;re a lazy dev like me that likes to keep his stuff in the terminal? Well, for this reason I wrote a small wrapper using some of my all time favorite tools: Ruby and FZF!</summary>

    <summary>Depending on how many languages you program in, getting all their version managers installed, added to &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;, configured etc... becomes quite a pain when setting up a new system, or even figuring out how this one works because you&apos;ve used something else for a while.</summary>
