      <title>A collection of Vim key binds</title>
      <description>In my never ending quest for an optimal Vim setup I am always looking for ways to improve. I've used Vim for about two months now and I'm still learning a lot. In this post I'm going to take you through a part of my .vimrc that describes my non-plugin key binds.</description>

      <title>Creating my own vim statusline</title>
      <description>Recently I decided to clean up my vim plugins once again, I do not think I use too many but I prefer to keep my setup simple. One of the things which bothered me was the configuration for lightline.vim in my vim config. It seemed needlessly complex and I wondered if I could recreate it without any plugins at all!</description>

      <title>Recruiters who call during working hours</title>
      <description>Any kind of cold-call from some random recruiter or sales rep is annoying enough as is. Imagine my frustration when I got a call from a recruiter who called on the &lt;strong&gt;company phone&lt;/strong&gt; in the middle of a working day!</description>

      <title>Codi.vim + fullscreen buffer</title>
      <description>Learn how to set up Codi.vim to create a fullscreen scratch buffer that also works with Vim splits. We will take a look at wrapping the &lt;code&gt;Codi&lt;/code&gt; command and improving the buffer name(s) as seen in &lt;code&gt;:ls&lt;/code&gt;.</description>

      <title>How FZF and ripgrep improved my workflow</title>
      <description>In my never ending quest for simplicity I recently discovered FZF and ripgrep. Two command-line tools that have the potential to make every dag programming tasks easier. In this post I will explain how I use these tools to do things in a matter of keystrokes rather than having to re-google that command you keep forgetting &lt;strong&gt;every. single. time.&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

      <title>The greatnesses and gotchas of YAML</title>
      <description>YAML is a great language for configuration files, it is a lot more flexible than JSON with comments and inheritance for example. While I was doing some research about YAML I found bits of information scattered all over the place so I attempted to piece the great things and the quirks together in a post!</description>

      <title>Switching to ASDF version manager</title>
      <description>Depending on how many languages you program in, getting all their version managers installed, added to &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;, configured etc... becomes quite a pain when setting up a new system, or even figuring out how this one works because you've used something else for a while.</description>

      <title>Vim tip: persistent undo</title>
      <description>Usually, when you open a file in your editor, make some changes, save and close, you lose the ability to &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Z&lt;/kbd&gt;. Vim has a built in mechanism to persist changes made to files on disk. This may not sound that exciting, but what if your editor crashes while you have a set of changes you may want to revert stored?</description>

      <title>Combining Caniuse with FZF</title>
      <description>There is caniuse.com which you can use to search online, but what if you're a lazy dev like me that likes to keep his stuff in the terminal? Well, for this reason I wrote a small wrapper using some of my all time favorite tools: Ruby and FZF!</description>

      <title>And your metered paywall isn't part of my story, Medium</title>
      <description>I've been greeted by the same "Your story isn't part of the metered paywall" message for a while now, and figured it was time to make a change in the right direction.</description>
