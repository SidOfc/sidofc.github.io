ASDF will use a local version over a global version.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter migrating from RVM, I had to rename my rubies.\nRVM stored them in the format of \u003ccode\u003eruby-[major]-[minor]-[patch]-p[ruby-patch]\u003c/code\u003e.\nThis caused ASDF not to switch after running \u003ccode\u003easdf local ruby 2.4.1\u003c/code\u003e because the folder\nname differed from the version input. Which meant I had to run \u003ccode\u003easdf local ruby ruby-2.4.1\u003c/code\u003e.\nIf a language is already specified, I\u0026#x27;d rather not bother typing it again.\nRemoving the \u003ccode\u003eruby-\u003c/code\u003e prefix from the directory names in \u003ccode\u003e~/.asdf/installs/ruby\u003c/code\u003e fixed it.\nRunning \u003ccode\u003easdf local ruby 2.4.1\u003c/code\u003e switched perfect afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class=\"heading_container__2UElk\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"heading_anchor__PWj4r\" id=\"extra-s\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca class=\"heading_link__1aoFY\" href=\"#extra-s\"\u003eExtra\u0026#x27;s\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA feature of the \u003ccode\u003easdf-ruby\u003c/code\u003e plugin is that it can install a set of \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby#default-gems\" title=\"Visit asdf-vm/asdf-ruby section on default gems\"\u003edefault gems\u003c/a\u003e\nspecified in a \u003ccode\u003e~/.default-gems file\u003c/code\u003e.

I rarely felt the need to create a gemset myself.\nThus not having this feature did not have a lot of impact on my workflow (yet).\nI\u0026#x27;m not sure if NVM adds any extra functionality, either way I think ASDF will fill the\ngaps because of how it was designed and how it can be extended.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, I added a \u003ccode\u003e~/.asdfrc\u003c/code\u003e file containing: \u003ccode\u003elegacy_version_file = yes\u003c/code\u003e.\nThis enables ASDF read all version files we know and love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class=\"heading_container__2UElk\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"heading_anchor__PWj4r\" id=\"conclusion\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca class=\"heading_link__1aoFY\" href=\"#conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for my shell time, it\u0026#x27;s back where it was with only RVM.

Install a plugin and you\u0026#x27;re done! A plugin system and a management system,\nbundled in 3 simple commands with a common interface.
