<kbd>^</kbd> which takes you to the first <em>non-whitespace</em> character of the current line\nand <kbd>L</kbd> maps to <kbd>$</kbd> which takes you to the <em>end</em> of the current line.\nI like to think of these mappings as stronger versions of the regular <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>l</kbd> motions in Vim.</p><p>The last mapping to discuss here is <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd>. What this does is open the previous buffer in the current\npane and close the buffer visible before that. This means that if I open <code>filea.txt</code> and then open\n<code>fileb.txt</code> in the same pane, pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> will show me filea.txt and close the buffer containing <code>fileb.txt</code>.\nI like this because I work with split panes a lot and I don&#x27;t always want my split to disappear when\nI&#x27;m done working with a file. Now it will show me the file I had open before that.</p><h3 class=\"heading_container__2UElk\"><a class=\"heading_anchor__PWj4r\" id=\"insert-mode-navigational-keys\"></a><a

some situations in insert mode and I hadn&#x27;t discovered <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd> yet either.\nI ended up using the hjkl combo I knew for moving around and prefixing it with control,\nso in insert mode, <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>l</kbd> moves me one character to the right, as <kbd>l</kbd> would do in normal mode.</p><p>Insert mode is not really the mode you want to be in most of the time, unless you are actually writing code that is.\nBut it is annoying to have to switch out of insert mode <em>just</em> to use a normal mode command to move to the right place.\nI found that using <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd> followed by a command used too many keypresses for the same operation and thus I\nended up with the <code>&lt;C-[direction]&gt;</code> keys for movement in insert
