We did set up\na little bit of dynamic styling in the <code>.indicator</code> element so set\nthe <code>width</code> equal to <code>${progress}%</code> and to set <code>opacity</code> to <code>1</code> whenever\nit is active (<code>progress</code> not <code>0</code> or <code>100</code>). You can go ahead\nand import and render it on your page.

<code>increment</code> and\n<code>complete</code> functions. The <code>start</code> function kicks off the process on\n<code>routeChangeStart</code>. It calls <code>setProgress(1)</code> which makes the progress bar\nvisible after a 0.2s delay defined in the CSS <code>opacity</code> transition.\nAfterwards, it also calls <code>increment()</code> which will repeatedly call itself\nusing <code>setTimeout</code> until a certain threshold has been reached (<code>80</code> in this case).\nThis will move the progress bar at random intervals with random percentages added.</p><p>Finally the <code>complete</code> function will be called either on <code>routeChangeComplete</code>\nor <code>routeChangeError</code> which will clear any remaining timeout set by <code>increment</code>\nand force the bar to <code>100</code> progress causing it to fill up and fade out.</p><p>We can safely leave <code>progress</code> at <code>100</code> here. There is no need to reset it\nto <code>0</code> because in our component logic we set <code>opacity</code> to <code>0</code> when the bar\nis either at <code>0</code> or <code>100</code> progress. Additionally when new navigation events\noccur the <code>start</code> function is called which always sets it to <code>1</code>.</p><h1 class=\"heading_container__2UElk\"><a
