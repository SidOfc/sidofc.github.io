Future me however,\nwas no longer satisfied by the cryptic block of configuration.</p><p>I also didn&#x27;t want to sink more time into demystifying it either. What I wanted,\nwas <strong>simplicity</strong>. After having gained some experience with Vim and writing\n<a href=\"https://github.com/SidOfc/mkdx\" title=\"Visit SidOfc/mkdx on GitHub\">my own markdown plugin</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/sidofc/treevial\" title=\"Visit SidOfc/treevial on github\">my own file explorer</a>\nI figured it was time to write my own statusline.</p><h2 class=\"heading_container__2UElk\"><a class=\"heading_anchor__PWj4r\" id=\"ditching-lightline\"></a><a class=\"heading_link__1aoFY\" href=\"#ditching-lightline\">Ditching lightline.vim</a></h2><p>First off, I&#x27;d like to emphasize that lightline.vim is a great plugin. I loved\nit until the very end and it allowed me to do whatever I wanted without having\nintricate knowledge of Vimscript.</p><p>The thing that broke me was the way the colors had to be specified,\nthe <code>let s:p</code> object with lots of nested lists which contained more lists\ndrove me crazy every time I looked at my vim config. It was a black box that\nI wanted to get rid of.</p><p>So finally, I decided to <strong>roll my own</strong>. It took me roughly two to three hours\nto figure out how I could make the statusline work the way I wanted using\nplain Vimscript in addition to stealing a small snippet from a statusline plugin\nto make sure only one statusline was active and unfocussed windows would\nshow a &quot;grayscale&quot; version. This is the pure-vimscript implementation I came up with:</p><pre class=\"prism-code language-viml\" style=\"background-color:#2a2734;color:#9a86fd\"><div class=\"token-line\"

lines</strong> for the <strong>entire implementation</strong>\nwhereas the <strong>lightline configuration</strong> weighs in at <strong>57 lines</strong>. Yes,\nmy entire implementation in less code than &quot;just&quot; the config for lightline.</p><p>This may actually not seem like much, but considering that lightline has to\ntake into account all kinds of configuration while rendering, it is actually\nquite a bit slower than this implementation as well. I felt a noticeable difference\nwhen scrolling up and down a file like a mad man.</p><h2 class=\"heading_container__2UElk\"><a class=\"heading_anchor__PWj4r\" id=\"conclusion\"></a><a class=\"heading_link__1aoFY\" href=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion</a></h2><p>For me, it was a nice challenge and good fun. I also really like the end\nresult as well. Remember when I showed the colors on my statusline?\nYeah I lied about that being lightline 😃</p><p>What you saw before is indeed my current implementation, and it actually\ndoes more than I could care to figure out how to achieve with lightline.\nI was able to get rid of netrw buffer names even though I don&#x27;t actually\nneed that anymore since I&#x27;m using my own file explorer :thinking:</p><p>Aside from that it shows more colors than the three mentioned above, here&#x27;s all\nof them in a short gif:</p><figure class=\"media_figure__1BF98\"><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"padding-bottom:4.266389177939646%\"></div></div><figcaption class=\"media_alt__xSx7S\">custom statusline showing all colors</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to blue for normal mode, yellow/green for insert, and purple for\nvisual modes, it also shows red when in replace mode and a nice orange\nwhen in EX mode!</p><p>The best part about this though, is that I can now do whatever I want\nwith this statusline using the power of Vimscript. No more abstract configuration\nand no more scary palette, just plain ol&#x27; Vimscript.</p><p>Now freed from statusline plugins and being able to cruise over files at the\nspeed of light, this concludes my story of creating my own statusline. I hope\nyou enjoyed it!</p><p>Until next time :)</p><p>👋</p>","scope":{"title":"Creating my own vim statusline","description":"Recently I decided to clean up my vim plugins once again, I do not think I use too many but I prefer to keep my setup simple.
