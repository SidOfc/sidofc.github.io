For that reason, I rebound them to \",mdx(\"kbd\",null,\"J\"),\" and \",mdx(\"kbd\",null,\"K\"),` instead (note their case).\nSince they apply no useful action in normal mode and they are more easily combined with the `,mdx(\"kbd\",null,\"shift\"),`\nkey than `,mdx(\"kbd\",null,\"{\"),\" and \",mdx(\"kbd\",null,\"}\"),\" it made sense to me to map them to something easier to reach.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Consistency\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Some of the key binds are actually inconsistent.
